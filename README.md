# Aviatto

What are we building?

In the purest sense, a landing page is any web page that a visitor can arrive at or “land” on. However, when discussing landing pages within the realm of marketing and advertising, it’s more common to refer to a landing page as being standalone pages that are designed for a specific focused objective.

What's interesting in the realm of learning modern CSS and Javascript is that they have, by definition, attractive design, UI animations and interactive elements such as image carousels and dynamic headers that change or expand depending on the screen scroll.

In this workshop you're going to practice both your CSS and JavaScript skills to create a landing page for the Aviatto service.
